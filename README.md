# Clustering_IRIS-datasets
IRIS dataset is a in built dataset in the python or R. One of the most common and interesting dataset to explore machine learning algorithm for learning prespective. I have used clustering technique. This dataset contain 150 records with 4 variables where sepal length , sepal width , petal length &amp; petal width are given. I have separated the datasets into two parts:  One part contains Sepal's information and another part contains Petal's information. With their different length and width sizes we are trying to build clusters using k-means clustering technique.
